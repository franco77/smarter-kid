# smarter-kid
This was a simple quiz game I designed for a class to test if you were smarter than an elementary school student. A user can select many different categories such as math, science, social studies, english, etc. They can also choose a grade level between 1st - 5th to be tested from. The number of points a user can get per question is dependent on the grade level chosen. Questions are pulled from the database and the user enters their answers in a text box. Both the user's answers and the correct answers from the database are then converted to lowercase to prevent any case-sensitive incorrect answers. The user is then taken to a results page showing their answers entered and the correct answers. A text of "correct/incorrect" is also shown beside each question. At the bottom the user has the option to enter their name in the high score table or to play the game again. If the user wants to enter their name, they are then taken to a high scores page showing all the top scores in a table format. The user can then play the game again from there.
